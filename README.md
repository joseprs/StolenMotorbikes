# StolenMotorbikes
Selection process test where I had to analyze the situation of stolen motorbikes in Spain during the last years to decide whether to push forward a functionality that will help motorbike riders find a stolen motorbike.

The analysis, along with its respective explanations and visualizations, can be found in the file StolenMotorbikes.ipynb.

The name of the company for which I completed the test has been anonymized and replaced with **"M"**.
